## Objective
The main Objective of the study is to compare existing regression models Such as 
* Random Forest Regression, 
* Support Vector Machine (SVM), 
and 
* Artificial Nural Network ANN 

to compare their Mean Squared Error (MSE) value and R-squared value and see which model performs better on this dataset.
